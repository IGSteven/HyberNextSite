At **HyberHost**, we take data protection seriously. That’s why we’re excited to announce the deployment of our **brand‐new offsite NAS** designed specifically to power our customer **VPS Backups**.\n\n---\n\n### Why World Backup Day Matters\n\nIn today’s digital landscape, losing data can have serious consequences—from lost productivity to long-term business disruptions.
